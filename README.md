# myBeerSelection

"My Beer Selection" is a React-based beer selection app to create personal beer selections based on user's tastes. Uses an API call on random beer generator considering user inputs.

## Target Users
I'm targeting beer drinkers who love exploring new types of beers and want to try different ones.

## Usage
My application can provide a fun environment for searching new beers and learning about them, as well as trying them out if they want! The unique descriptions and brewer's tips can vividly illustrate each beer being featured, and they could really get people to try it.

## Built with:
- React
- API
- CSS3
- HTML5

## To-Do's
Some things I'd love to include to improve my app:
- use of Express.js to store user's selection data
- log-in option to store each user's selection data
- finding another API that I can use to provide more beer options 
- hyperlinks to The Beer Store or LCBO for users to purchase picked beers (The current API's beers are not sold on The Beer Store or LCBO.)
- hiding 'check my selection' button when the screen is showing the selection section
- option to show similar beers without complicating the UI or UX
- catalog page showing all beers in API with info
